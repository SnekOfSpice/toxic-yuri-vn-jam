[]>narrator: The next morning, Argo awakes to a sleeping Nessa and it can't remember when it was last awake [wave amp=8.0 freq=7.0 connected=1]already[/wave] at this hour but just seeing Nessa sleep is such a gift; The hangover is but a vague shadow in this ocean of affection and adoration. It grabs its phone, dozes in and out of sleep, and eventually Nessa rises and pomfs on top of Argo, who holds her without a second thought and now they're so so close again and Argo loves her so much and they're making out again and this time they're both cooled down so their lust has space to ignite once more and it does with a fiery explosion.
[]>narrator: They ravnously strip each other of their clothes, careful not to disturb Nessa's bandages, and Argo nuzzles at her crotch as it does and it gets so fucking delirously horny from it and almost passes out but snaps back to tend to the rest of the girl and so with hungry predatory claws it rakes across Nessa's skin it kisses her body and holds her so close and pins her underneath before breeding her to high heavens, leg-locked and everything, and they kiss for so fucking long and they kiss and squish and felch and fuck this is amazing. Words are so overrated when you can just copulate, barely bother cleaning up, and then go at it again.
[]>narrator: Having a girlfriend is awesome, Argo thinks. <mp>Nessa thinks so too.
