[]>narrator: Maya has continued exhuming dirt at the hole, and will continue for the foreseeable future. her sweat is running down her naked form, percolating and glistening in the sunlight and absorbing all the terrible corpsestench the hole apathetically exudes. Roaches is so fucking turned on by the smell. harsh Noise just vomited down the gravel pile it's keeping watch on. Roaches got it on tape while dualwielding the camera and its dick. the footage is a bit grainy and shaky but whatever.

[]>narrator: <call:hide_window(3)>Maya shovels dirt until the sky adopts the colors of haleys skin, and is then swallowed by the cosmic array of stars growing into the nightly firmament overhead, which means fuck all because this work is a lot.
[]>narrator: The sky is dark, Harsh Noise gave Roaches a flashlight to illuminate the scene and it's horrible for everyone involved and so so tiring but what else are they gonna do.
[]>narrator: Haley continues to rot half a pace away from them.
LINE 9
[]>roaches: wait a sec.
[]>maya: ...
[]>narrator: Roaches gives maya a kiss, then switches to a new SD card. The kiss was a nicer change of mood than Maya anticipated and that makes it infinitely more bitter considering Haley is right there so she just gets her head down in the dirt again. <mp>This one is gonna be a hella fucking cool closeup, Roaches thinks. Harsh Noise is looking at them intently. Its guard duty got hella boring. Its cupping its dick and balls in hand. Where else is it supposed to go.
[]>narrator: Xelia is scrubbing dried blood and corpsejuice from her porch. Noni is getting consoled by Riley again. Nessa is crying, waiting for Argo to come home. The world isn't kind to them.
[]>narrator: The world has already started to forget Haley.
LINE 10
[]>narrator: Maya puts the shovel down. It'll be a shallow grave but it's more symbolic than anything else anyways.

[]>harshnoise: positive.
[]>roaches: hi.
[]>maya: hey.
[]>narrator: Roaches leans in for a quick kiss over Haley's body. Maya's heart flutters.

[]>narrator: makeout cg
[]>narrator: Roaches pushes Maya back against the nearest tree, knee lodged between her legs, lips locked and tongue wrestling. roaches tightly grips maya's wrists and noise is getting it all on camera and maya grinds back and she's so fucking wet from this and roaches and her finally smell the same kind of bad, which so fucking intoxicating god.
[]>narrator: roaches scratches and prods at maya's soft soft abdomen, maay moans back into its mouth, their dicks twitch against one another with nthing but roaches' clothes separating them, who lets a hand wander down between their bodies and now both their dicks are in her filthy grasp and it feels so electrifying, all the tiniest strands of hair on maya's body completely on edge, as is she, almost immediately
[]>maya: god..

LINE 11
[]>narrator: Argo is getting off its shift at the gas station once more and it sucks it didn't get vacation but such is life and it gets picked up by Audrey once more. They don't talk. 
LINE 12
[]>narrator: Argo tries not to acknowledge the weight of its conscious, and this'll haunt it eventually in the aftermath. For now, literally do anything more to stave off the existential grindstone of grief and bring more puppies home.
[]>narrator: The sun is just coming up, and where the blood of girls couldn't reach, the cracks in the concrete are filled by the colors of dusk.
[]>narrator: With half an hour to go, Argo and Audrey pull up to the shelter.

[]>narrator{target|1}: Discarded, left to rot on the gutter. Like xelia. Like Roaches. Like Noni. Like Haley. Like Maya. 
[]>narrator: This one doesn't even have a name yet. Nothing but the dog tag around it's neck, and the stab wound in its gut.
[]>narrator: It'll bleed out in less than thirty minutes, just like the countless girls before it.
[]>narrator: It's a scared and shaking mess and clings to the rags it calls clothes while it soaks in torrential downpour.
[]>argo{target|1}: Fuck...
[]>narrator: A pitiful sight.
[]>argo: They're definitely using the rain to mask the blood
[]>narrator: If its stomach had any contents, they'd have long been emptied
[]>audrey{target|1}: You know emergency stiches, yeah?
[]>argo: Yea...
[]>audrey: Well get to it then.
[]>narrator: <ts_abs:10>another <ap>bad <ap>dog. <advance>
[]>argo: Fuck that.
[]>narrator: Argo applies pressure to the wounded puppy's wounds, then Audrey takes over and delivers some really shittily applied wound glue and staples but what's the best they can offer right now besides a quick extraction and prevention of bleeding out, that's a pretty good offer if you ask audrey. Argo just wants to go home. 
LINE 16
[]>narrator: Maya steps away from the grave.
[]>narrator: Audrey steps on the gas. 
[]>narrator: argo is looking at its reflection in the car window. It wishes it was Nessa's face it could look at.
[]>narrator: The puppy rustles awake. Argo's eyes wander back onto the rear bench, away from its frontal lobe.
[]>maya{target|1}:Please rest now.<advance>
[]>argo{target|2}:Hey, pup.
