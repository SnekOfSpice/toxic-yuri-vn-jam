[]>haley:Maya...
[]>haley:you fucking bitch
[]>narrator:A palm full of puppy face is Haleys answer. Grabbing her pet with zero concern for the pose of her body, Haley drags Maya down to leglock it a bit, having it instantly melt into a sleepy makeout session. <lc>One hand grabbing at its firm rear, while the other scratches across Maya's throat, Haley does what she on some level thinks will make Maya less likely to leave her- Leave her for someone else. Please just fucking stay one more minute. fuck I want you I fucking hate this so much and- <ap>Maya pulls away.

[]>narrator:Roaches on top. Ass covered in drool and firmly planted on Mayas face. <mp>Noise's rut makes for a nice auxiliary rhythm to getting eaten out. Maya stopped caring that Roaches regularly hasn't showered in a week about 2 hours after meeting them for the first time a year ago. <mp>About the same time, Roaches found her tongue to be so eager, enticed by its esrthy taste. Roaches deliberately dorsnt shower before dates now. Maya hasnt noticed yet. <mp>She'd be more turned on if she knew. Noise oeeps staring at her purpling hands, jutting out from mayas ziptied wrists. 
[]>narrator: Noise is almost mesmerized by how close to corpsecolor they are. "You're gorgeous" it mumbles. "I wish you were dead." Maya fiercely leglocks Noise at that, pulls Roaches down hard. With every unleashed moan, its amphetamine-laced spit and snot drops down onto mayas paws. "you should tell her so many more death threats. fuck".
[]>narrator: "mhm" Noise doesn't want to fall asleep.
[]>narrator: "Flip it over." Noise proposes. <mp> "Fuck yeah." Roaches concurs. <mp>Maya doesn't fucking matter.
[]>narrator: Roaches removes itself from atop it's whimpering seat and straddles it's face.
[]>narrator: Harsh Noise: "bitch"
[]>narrator: Roaches: "sorry, gotta rut into her face for a bit."
[]>narrator: Harsh Noise: "I'll deck you."
[]>narrator: Roaches: "try me"
[]>narrator: Maya grinds its thigh against Noise, teasing out amicability. It's still turned on by the prospect of them fighting over its holes.
[]>narrator: "Fine, fine."
[]>narrator: Maya signals happiness with choked coos as noise grinds its dick against its hole again.
[]>narrator: Roaches: "Still wanna doggy spitroast this bitch"
[]>narrator: Harsh Noise just pushes her away with a gentle tap on the chest, and then grabs Maya by the hips, who so so eagerly gets on all fours for its two lovers. Her paws practically sink into the damp sheets.
[]>narrator: Roaches grabs a fistful of her doggy scruff, grinding her lolling tongue into its crotch. The pressure against its pelvis is fucking mindblowing when paired with the meth lodged up its nostril.
