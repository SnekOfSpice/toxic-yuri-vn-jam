[]>argo: Xelia is... a shelter girlie, basically grew up there.
[]>argo: After she escaped or got out... or whatever...
[]>argo: It was rough.
[]>argo: Her only contact left was Leah, I don't know how but they kept in touch throughout all that.
[]>argo: But she was so... 
[]>argo: Okay I think everyone can see that she's a bougie fuck. She runs a successful vet clinic
[]>argo: And that rakes in bucks
[]>argo: She has a husband for fucks' sake.
[]>argo: A cissexual husband.
[]>vanessa: What the fuck!
[]>narrator{target|2}:<call:show_image(xelia_dmt)>xelia's face feels like digital static, a feeling dragging her down into a sedation required to make the world a bearable place.
[]>argo: Exactly
[]>argo: She's of our flock and just... fucked off.
[]>narrator:If there's a sedation left to be found in this world, Xelia is not aware of it. But with the spine of color winding its way around her concious, she writes and revels in the knowing of boundaryvoid shapes.
[]>argo: "Oh yeah I got bottom surgery and now I don't need to snort ketamine with you faggots anymore!"
[]>argo: She didn't say that.
[]>argo: But you know... that was the vibe.
[]>xelia{target|2}:How about you shup up and... yes...
[]>argo: Fuck...
[]>narrator:Deep breaths.
[]>argo: Fuck! I don't even know why I'm so... toxic towards her right now.
[]>xelia:Shallow breaths.
[]>vanessa: It's fine.
[]>xelia:Fuck...
[]>vanessa: You probably don't have many you can talk to about this?
[]>argo: No one lol.
[]>vanessa: Yea, see?
[]>argo: ...
[]>vanessa:...
[]>vanessa: It's fine.
[]>xelia:Lock your mind and fucking FINALLY be SOMETHING.
[]>vanessa: So. She kinda left you and or xelia to fend for yourselves?
[]>argo: Xelia, mostly.
[]>argo: She ran out of cash eventually and didn't wanna whore herself out.
[]>argo: So drug business it was.
[]>argo: Mostly killed and intimidated herself up the supply chain until she was comfortable enough.
[]>vanessa: Holy fuck.
[]>argo: You can... see where the schism arises.
[]>argo: Leah wasn't too keen on bloodshed.
[]>argo: Me neither, to be frank.
[]>argo: <call:hide_all_windows()>But then you learn of the fuckers she iced.
[]>argo: Nazis and the like.
[]>argo: And you start to become more sympathetic.
[]>vanessa: Or you did
[]>argo: You wouldnt?
[]>vanessa: Truth be told, I'm already kinda there. <mp>I think Audrey even alluded to it when we hung out a few days ago or whenever that was?
[]>vanessa:Audrey and I sometimes go shooting.
[]>vanessa:You know.
[]>argo: Oh. Good.
[]>vanessa: Heh.
[]>argo: Anyways
[]>argo: Yea I did too
[]>argo: Said fuck it
[]>argo: Girl has a point
[]>vanessa: And drugs
[]>argo: ...And drugs.
[]>argo: ...And just didn't cut her off from my life
[]>argo: We still hung out.
[]>argo:I mean also because I just like her?? She's a good friend to me.
[]>argo: I just... didn't bring her up in front of Leah anymore
[]>argo: And that's that.
[]>vanessa: And so how did you two meet then?
[]>argo: Just online. Noticed we have the same mindset in many regards.
[]>argo:And the... miracle happens.
[]>argo:Online friend that lives somewhat close to you.
[]>vanessa:Awesome.
[]>vanessa:Happy for you.
[]>argo:Thanks.
